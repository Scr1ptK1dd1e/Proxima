# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Richard Compton

I am the definition of the term "jack of all trades", addicted to Cybersecurity and Programming. I've heard the Cybersecurity field described as "a mile wide and an inch deep" and to gain a basic understanding this is somewhat true. However, each and every area presents enough depth to build an **entire career** off of and for the last 3 years, I've accomplished a lot and shared very little despite constantly trying to find ways to do so as I want to present things in both a useful, professional in appearance and contiguous manner and for the presentation of my work to be easy enough to not inhibit the performance of it. It feels as if an entire doctorate is "on the ip of my tongue".

## Continuing Education
Hold on... I've got hundreds.. or thousands... of hours I've got to track down lol.


## Weakpoints
Self-investment - I've been so desperate to just get employed, rushing to get a Bachelors degree and doing certifications that I haven't properly followed through with a majority of my interests, most of which would probably have solved my financial issues to some degree or even served as proof-of-concept of my ability and got me hired faster than any certification. Like how my github is effectively empty to viewers.

Lack of Network - Everything I've achieved, learned, worked on has been solely of my own origination and volition. I'm somewhat proud of this fact but I've come to realize that my lack of a network has deprived me of any reward and most opportunity for my efforts.

Scheduling & Contact - Due to working on my own for so long, I've become absolutely terrible at remembering appointments and missing calls. It might take me 2 days to a week to realize someone called me.
