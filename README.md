# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Richard Compton

I am the definition of the term "jack of all trades", addicted to Cybersecurity and Programming. I've heard the Cybersecurity field described as "a mile wide and an inch deep" and to gain a basic understanding this is somewhat true. However, each and every area presents enough depth to build an **entire career** off of and for the last 3 years, I've accomplished a lot and shared very little despite constantly trying to find ways to do so as I want to present things in both a useful, professional in appearance and contiguous manner and for the presentation of my work to be easy enough to not inhibit the performance of it. It feels as if an entire doctorate is "on the ip of my tongue".

## Continuing Education
Hold on... I've got hundreds.. or thousands... of hours I've got to track down lol.


## Weakpoints
Self-investment - I've been so desperate to just get employed that I haven't properly followed through with a majority of my interests, most of which would probably have solved my financial issues to some degree or even served as proof-of-concept of my ability and got me hired faster than any certification.

Lack of Network - Everything I've achieved, learned, worked on has been solely of my own origination and volition. I'm somewhat proud of this fact but I've come to realize that my lack of a network has deprived me of any reward and most opportunity for my efforts.

Context & Purpose - While most people have a job and a network well before they reach my level of understanding in anything, I do not and this results in some knowledge gaps. Most of those end up being contextual. I may know how to do something but don't see some obvious application for it that anyone with a single day of experience in a doing IT or Dev in a company would easily recognize. Similarly, almost everything I do is just because I'm interested in it and may not necessarily have a purpose. At this point, interest only takes you so far and without a clear payoff at the end, it's hard for me to justify what I'm doing. this is probably why I don't finish most projects. Once I've learned what I can I'll end up losing interest alltogether most times. Code a whole website but can't afford to actually register DNS or host it sooo, let's throw the code away.. stuff like that. I assume this habit will lead to issues in the future but I also figure all of this is self-correcting fairly quickly once the world picks me up and applies me to something.

Scheduling & Contact - Due to working on my own for so long, I've become absolutely terrible at remembering appointments and missing calls. I pretty much just don't socialize anymore as I can't afford to do literally anything so the phone is pretty useless on a day-to-day and since I'm not tied to it I'll miss 50% or more of the attempts to contact me.
